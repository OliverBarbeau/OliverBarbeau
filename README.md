### Hey, I'm Oliver

I studied Computer Science at the University of Minnesota while spending a decade in Minneapolis fine dining; including James Beard-recognized restaurants Oro by Nixta and Popol Vuh. Hospitality taught me to anticipate needs, and stay calm under pressure. Now I bring that same standard to the software I build.
